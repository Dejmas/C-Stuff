# Lets Synchronize 2 Counters


Suppose we have two threads. One is printing out odd numbers (1,3,5,...) and onother one is printing out even numbers (2,4,6,...). Lets synchronize them so that output is 1,2,3,...

Conditional Variable helps you block the thread and also notify the thread that something changed.
